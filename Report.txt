# 📊 **Recommendation System using Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
### *Summary Report*

---

## 🔧 1. RL Setup

- **Environment**: A custom OpenAI Gym-style environment (`RecommendationEnv`) was built to simulate user responses to marketing actions based on real-like user profile features.
  
- **State Space**: Each user is represented by 10 numerical features:
  - `recency`, `frequency`, `monetary_value`, `engagement_score`
  - `discount_sensitive`, `free_shipping_preferred`
  - `email_opens`, `sms_response`, `push_response`, `last_purchase_days`

- **Action Space**: A discrete list of recommendation strategies (e.g., sending a discount via email or SMS).

- **Reward Function**: Designed to simulate user satisfaction:
  - +0.5 for correct targeting (e.g., discounts for sensitive users)
  - +0.3 for matching preferred channels (e.g., email for high open rates)
  - Clipped total reward ∈ [0, 1]

- **Algorithm Used**: [Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)] from `Stable-Baselines3`
  - Chosen for its reliability in discrete action spaces and ease of tuning.
  
- **Vectorized Environment**: `DummyVecEnv` used to support batched training.

## 📌 2. Key Takeaways

- **Personalization**: RL effectively learned to recommend personalized strategies based on user behavior profiles.

- **Reward Optimization**: The agent quickly learned to maximize rewards by aligning actions with user preferences (e.g., discount + email for sensitive users with high open rate).

- **Interpretability**: The state and actions remain interpretable, useful for debugging and business insights.

## 📈 3. Sample Outputs

Example simulation for a trained agent:

```text
🧍 User Features:
recency: 15.00
frequency: 3.00
monetary_value: 200.00
engagement_score: 0.78
discount_sensitive: 1.00
free_shipping_preferred: 0.00
email_opens: 0.87
sms_response: 0.12
push_response: 0.05
last_purchase_days: 8.00

🤖 Agent Action Chosen:
Action #2 → ['discount', 15%, 'email']

🏆 Reward Achieved: 0.9
```

The agent correctly detected discount sensitivity and matched the preferred communication channel (`email`), leading to a high reward.

## 🚀 4. Suggestions for Scaling to Real Users

- **Data Collection**: Integrate with real e-commerce user logs to train on actual user behavior rather than simulated profiles.

- **Reward Tuning**: Incorporate actual user engagement metrics (click-through rates, conversion, etc.) into the reward function.

- **Action Expansion**: Support more complex actions such as bundling, timing optimization, or dynamic discounts.

- **Model Interpretability**: Add SHAP or LIME-based explainability modules to help non-technical stakeholders understand recommendations.

- **Continuous Learning**: Deploy in an online learning setup where the model adapts based on real-time feedback from users.

## 💡 5. Future Work

- Integrate deep user embeddings using unsupervised learning to enrich state space.
- Test with other RL algorithms like A2C, DQN for comparison.
- Deploy as a REST API for real-time recommendation serving.
- Explore multi-agent setups for group recommendations or campaign optimization.
